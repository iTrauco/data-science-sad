# ISO 17025 Compliant 3D Scanner Data Processing Pipeline System Design Proposal

## Scenario Overview
A research engineer needs to establish a validated processing pipeline for 3D scanner data to meet ISO 17025 audit requirements. They want to implement automated validation and traceability for .stl and .ply files from their SIMSCAN scanner but face challenges with documenting measurement validation, ensuring data integrity through processing, and maintaining audit trails and are unsure where to start. They have Python scripts on a Linux server and must deliver cleaned .stl files with verified dimensions to customers. This proposal outlines a systems approach for pipeline development, data handling, and validationâ€”including infrastructure recommendations for scalability and reproducibility.

## Proposal Framework
This Jupyter notebook presents a systems analysis and design approach to the research data pipeline challenge. The proposal follows established information systems design principles, emphasizing:
- **Systematic Analysis**: Methodical breakdown of research data processing requirements
- **Pipeline Architecture**: Structured approach to automated validation and processing
- **Data Integrity Engineering**: Comprehensive validation and verification systems
- **Infrastructure Planning**: Scalable research computing architecture

## System Components
The proposed solution addresses the following key subsystems:
1. **Validation Pipeline**
   - Automated validation mechanisms
   - Measurement verification processes
   - Data integrity checks
2. **Processing Pipeline**
   - File cleaning operations
   - Data transformation workflows
   - Python script integration
3. **Audit Trail System**
   - Traceability implementation
   - Process logging architecture
   - Documentation tracking
4. **Measurement Documentation**
   - Dimension verification system
   - Validation documentation
   - Measurement recording
5. **Output Delivery System**
   - Cleaned .stl file generation
   - Verified dimensions documentation
   - Customer delivery mechanism

## Implementation Considerations
The proposal includes high-level specifications for:
- Research workflow automation strategies
- Data pipeline reliability engineering
- System integration architecture
- Performance optimization approaches
- Error recovery mechanisms

## Reproducibility Framework
