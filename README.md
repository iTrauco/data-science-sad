# AI, ML, and Data Science Systems Analysis and Design

This repository contains case studies demonstrating systems analysis and design approaches for AI, ML, and data science infrastructure. The examples showcase methodologies for architecting effective computational environments for research and analytics.

## Purpose

This repository demonstrates technical approaches to designing and implementing AI and ML systems that balance performance, scalability, and usability. It highlights architectural considerations for supporting data-intensive research and analytics workflows.

## Structure

The repository uses a simple branching strategy:
- `main`: Contains final versions of all case study responses
- Feature branches for individual scenarios, each with its own README

## Technologies

The case studies explore various technologies and methodologies including but not limited to:
- Neural network architectures and frameworks
- Computing infrastructure (cloud, HPC)
- Data processing and storage systems
- Model training and evaluation frameworks
- Reproducibility and versioning tools
- Research workflow design
