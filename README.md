# Microscopy Image Classification: Jupyter-Based Strategy for Biology Research Teams

## Scenario Overview

A biology research team wants to use deep learning to classify microscopy images into cell types. They have thousands of images, some labeled, and access to an HPC cluster with GPUs. They have limited programming experience. This proposal outlines a strategic approach using Jupyter notebooks to enable effective deep learning implementation for microscopy image analysis.

## Strategic Approach

This proposal leverages Jupyter notebooks via Anaconda to create a research-focused environment for microscopy image classification. Our strategy follows these principles:
