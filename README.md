# Extreme Imbalance Anomaly Detection System Design Proposal

## Scenario Overview
A seismic research team is monitoring earthquake sensor data from regional networks. They want to compare neural network approaches (autoencoders, CNNs for spectrograms, ensemble methods) to detect rare seismic events but have highly imbalanced data (~10M readings at 100Hz sampling rate, <0.1% actual seismic events) and are unsure where to start. They have access to an HPC cluster with GPUs. This proposal outlines a systems approach for model development, data handling, and evaluation-including infrastructure recommendations for scalability and reproducibility.

## Proposal Framework
This Jupyter notebook presents a systems analysis and design approach to the extreme imbalance anomaly detection challenge. The proposal follows established information systems design principles, emphasizing:
- **Systematic Analysis**: Methodical breakdown of imbalance characteristics and anomaly patterns
- **Architectural Planning**: Structured approach to system components and their interactions
- **Core Pipeline Components**: Essential building blocks for end-to-end implementation
- **Evaluation Framework**: Comprehensive assessment methodology

## System Components
The proposed solution addresses the following key subsystems:
1. **Data Processing Subsystem**
   - Data flow architecture
   - Extreme imbalance handling mechanisms
   - Pre-processing pipeline design
2. **Model Development Framework**
   - Architecture selection methodology
   - Training system design
   - Parameter optimization approach
3. **Evaluation Infrastructure**
   - Metrics selection framework
   - Validation process design
   - Performance analysis system
4. **Computing Environment Architecture**
   - Resource allocation strategy
   - Scaling methodology
   - System integration approach
5. **Reproducibility Framework**
   - Version control strategy
   - Environment specification

## Implementation Considerations
The proposal includes high-level specifications for:
- Recommended technology stack
- System integration points
- Resource requirements
- Core pipeline components
- Learning resources through case study implementation and framework selection

## Reproducibility Framework
### Environment Setup

This project uses a Conda environment to manage dependencies for reproducible analysis. Environment specifications and setup instructions will be provided once the specific requirements for the extreme imbalance anomaly detection challenge have been confirmed.

This notebook serves as a comprehensive system design proposal, providing the seismic research team with a structured approach to implementing neural network architectures for their extreme imbalance anomaly detection task.
