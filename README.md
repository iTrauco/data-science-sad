# 3D Scan Format Conversion System Design Proposal

## Scenario Overview
A research team needs to develop a system to manage and convert 3D scan formats from their SIMSCAN scanner. They want to build a Linux-based workflow that handles multiple file formats (.pj3, .pjs, .igs, .txt, .mk2, .umk, .stl, .ply, .obj) from their scanning operations but face challenges with format conversion routines, extracting consistent metadata across formats, and implementing an efficient storage hierarchy and are unsure where to start. They have Linux servers, Python scripting experience, and some data pipeline tools and need to deliver a solution that allows researchers to access any scan in any required format with proper version tracking. This proposal outlines a systems approach for format conversion, metadata management, and storage organization including infrastructure recommendations for scalability and reproducibility.

## Proposal Framework
This Jupyter notebook presents a systems analysis and design approach to the 3D scan format conversion challenge. The proposal follows established information systems design principles, emphasizing:
- **Systematic Analysis**: Methodical breakdown of 3D format requirements and conversion workflows
- **Pipeline Architecture**: Structured approach to automated format conversion and validation
- **Metadata Management**: Framework for consistent metadata extraction and organization
- **Storage Engineering**: Scalable design for efficient file organization and version tracking

## System Components
The proposed solution addresses the following key subsystems:
1. **Format Conversion Pipeline**
   - Conversion workflow architecture
   - Format compatibility matrix
   - Conversion quality validation
2. **Metadata Extraction System**
   - Common metadata schema design
   - Format-specific extraction routines
   - Metadata validation framework
3. **Storage Organization Framework**
   - Directory structure design
   - Naming convention system
   - Storage optimization approach
4. **Version Tracking System**
   - File history tracking
   - Change documentation
   - Version comparison tools
5. **Access Interface Architecture**
   - Query mechanism design
   - User permission framework
   - Format selection workflow

## Implementation Considerations
The proposal includes high-level specifications for:
- Recommended 3D format processing libraries and tools
- System integration with existing Linux infrastructure
- Performance optimization for large scan file handling
- Metadata extraction and validation approaches
- Version control implementation strategy

## Reproducibility Framework
### Environment Setup

This project uses a Conda environment to manage dependencies for reproducible analysis. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

#### Prerequisites
- Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your system
- Git for cloning the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iTrauco/data-science-sad.git
   cd data-science-sad
   git checkout scenario08/3d-scan/format-conversion
   ```

2. Create the Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n scenario8-format-conversion python=3.11 -y
   ```

3. Activate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate scenario8-format-conversion
   ```

4. Install baseline packages:
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib -y
