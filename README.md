# Multi-Object Tracking Computer Vision System Design Proposal

## Scenario Overview
A transportation research team wants to analyze traffic camera footage to detect and track vehicles across multiple highway locations. They want to use computer vision models with optimization for deployment but struggle with handling streaming video data, model compression, and inference pipeline design and are unsure where to start. They have access to an HPC workstation with GPU and GCP for video storage and pipeline processing. This proposal outlines a systems approach for model development, data handling, and evaluation-including infrastructure recommendations for scalability and reproducibility.

## Proposal Framework
This Jupyter notebook presents a systems analysis and design approach to the multi-object tracking computer vision challenge. The proposal follows established information systems design principles, emphasizing:
- **Systematic Analysis**: Methodical breakdown of video processing and tracking requirements
- **Architectural Planning**: Structured approach to system components and their interactions
- **Core Pipeline Components**: Essential building blocks for end-to-end implementation
- **Evaluation Framework**: Comprehensive assessment methodology

## System Components
The proposed solution addresses the following key subsystems:
1. **Data Processing Subsystem**
   - Data flow architecture
   - Video streaming and processing mechanisms
   - Pre-processing pipeline design
2. **Model Development Framework**
   - Architecture selection methodology
   - Training system design
   - Parameter optimization approach
3. **Evaluation Infrastructure**
   - Metrics selection framework
   - Validation process design
   - Performance analysis system
4. **Computing Environment Architecture**
   - Resource allocation strategy
   - Scaling methodology
   - System integration approach
5. **Reproducibility Framework**
   - Version control strategy
   - Environment specification

## Implementation Considerations
The proposal includes high-level specifications for:
- Recommended technology stack
- System integration points
- Resource requirements
- Core pipeline components
- Learning resources through case study implementation and framework selection

## Reproducibility Framework
